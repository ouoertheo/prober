Probes
    Probe Class
        Each probe will be responsible for its own polling loop
        Will have start_probe function to initialize polling
        All probes will have an execute function that returns true or false.
        All probes will be responsible its config and their metric.
        A probe will log a warning on failure.
        A probe will track its total failures.
        Each probe will store its own collection interval

    Probe Implementations
        DNS - No Prerequisites to run 
            dns_mx_somain - The MX record for the domain provided in the configuration exists
            dns_mx_ip - the targets of the MX records contain the IP in the configuration

        Connectivity - No prerequisites to run
            ip_ping - the ip address of the server is pingable
            http_port - port 80 can be connected to. 
            https_port - port 443 can be connected to
            mail_port - port 25 can be connected to
            smtp_port - port 587 can be connected to
        
        Security - Must Pass Connectivity first
            https_certificate - There is a certificate bound to the hostname on port 443
            smtp_certificate - There is a certificate bound to the hostname on port 587

        Mail Send   
            smtp_send - Secure smtp connection to the server can be initiated

Main Application Class
    Responsible for initializing all Probes
    Creates a threadpool the size of total probes
    Initializes Each probe's execute function within the threadpool

External interface
    Export Prometheus Client metric:
        counter: email_probe_success_count
            Labels:
                success: true|false
